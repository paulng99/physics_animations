I will create a comprehensive **AI Image Generator** page that gives you full access to `fal.ai` models.

### 1. Create `ai_image_generator.html`
I will build a powerful interface with the following features:

*   **Universal Model Selector**:
    *   **Curated List**: Quick access to popular models like *Flux.1*, *SDXL*, *Recraft V3*, etc.
    *   **"All Models" Search**: I will implement a feature to fetch the full list of 600+ models from `fal.ai`'s registry so you can search and select *any* available model.
    *   **Custom ID Support**: You can also manually type any model ID (e.g., `fal-ai/my-custom-lora`).

*   **Dynamic Input Form**:
    *   The form will automatically adjust based on the selected model.
    *   **Smart Fields**: If you select a known model, I'll show specific sliders and dropdowns (e.g., "Style" for Recraft, "Inference Steps" for Flux).
    *   **Auto-Discovery**: I will try to fetch the "OpenAPI Schema" for the selected model to automatically generate the correct input fields.
    *   **Advanced Mode**: A "Raw JSON" editor for full control over parameters that aren't automatically detected.

*   **Secure & Fast**:
    *   API Key stored securely in your browser.
    *   Real-time image generation using the `fal.ai` client SDK.

### 2. Integration
*   I will add a **"✨ AI Studio"** link to your main `index.html` navigation bar.

### Verification
*   I will verify that you can switch between models and the form updates accordingly.
*   I will test generating an image with a standard model (Flux) to ensure the pipeline works.

I have analyzed the project files, including `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and several HTML simulation files. Based on the analysis, I have designed a comprehensive set of project rules to ensure consistency and maintainability.

Here is the plan to implement these rules:

1.  **Create `.cursorrules` file**: I will create a new file named `.cursorrules` in the root directory. This file will serve as the central instruction set for AI assistants and developers.
2.  **Define Rules Content**: The file will contain sections on:
    *   **Project Philosophy**: Emphasizing the single-file, no-build-tool architecture.
    *   **Tech Stack**: Documenting the use of Vanilla JS, Tailwind (CDN), Three.js, and Canvas.
    *   **Design System Compliance**: Explicitly linking to `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` for visual standards and Physics Semantic Colors.
    *   **Coding Conventions**: detailing the HTML structure, embedded script patterns, and naming conventions.
    *   **Internationalization (I18n)**: Standardizing the `data-i18n` approach.
    *   **Responsiveness**: Enforcing mobile-first design and specific Tailwind breakpoints.
3.  **Verification**: I will ensure the new rules align with the existing `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` without contradiction.

The `.cursorrules` file will effectively "codify" the unwritten and written laws of this project.

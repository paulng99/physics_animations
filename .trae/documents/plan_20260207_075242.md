I will implement the "Convex Lens" simulation using **Three.js** for 3D visualization, combining the 3D environment of the Motor Effect page with the advanced features of the Double-Slit page.

### 1. Create `Convex_Lens_3D.html`
I will create a new HTML file featuring:
*   **3D Visualization (Three.js)**:
    *   **Lens**: A 3D glass-like convex lens model (using scaled geometries).
    *   **Object & Image**: 3D arrows (Cylinder + Cone) representing the object and the formed image.
    *   **Ray Tracing**: 3D lines representing the three principal rays (Parallel$\to$Focus, Center, Focus$\to$Parallel) in 3D space.
    *   **Interactive Controls**: Rotate and zoom the scene to view the optical path from any angle.
*   **AI & Education Features**:
    *   **Gemini API**: "Explain This Concept" button to generate AI explanations of the current lens setup.
    *   **MathJax**: Render the lens formula $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u}$ cleanly.
*   **UI & System**:
    *   Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern interface.
    *   Language switching (EN/ZH/CN).
    *   Feedback form.

### 2. Update `index.html`
I will add the new tool to the **Optics** section:
*   **Card**: "3D Convex Lens Image Formation"
*   **Link**: `Convex_Lens_3D.html`
*   **Tag**: "3D Interactive"

### 3. Technical Approach
*   **Scene Setup**: Replicate the lighting, camera, and mouse interaction logic from `Motor_Effect_3D.html`.
*   **Physics Logic**: Calculate image position $v$ and height $h'$ in real-time. Handle virtual images (rendering them as semi-transparent or ghosted arrows).
*   **Materials**: Use `THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial` or `MeshStandardMaterial` with transmission/opacity to make the lens look realistic.
